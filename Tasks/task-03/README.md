# Task 03: Submission Form Layout

## Overview
This task involved creating a high-fidelity **Submission Form Page** for an awards program. The objective was to build a clean,
functional interface that balances informational content with a structured data-entry section, ensuring a seamless user experience.
The design features a distinct two-column layout: a descriptive left-hand panel and a comprehensive submission form on the right.

## Key Features & Implementation
* **Two-Column Architecture:** * **Left Panel:** Contains the "Award Submission" branding, descriptions, and deadline information.
    * **Right Panel:** A structured form for user data.
* **Complex Form Elements:** Styled various input types to match the design specs, including text fields, email inputs, custom
     checkboxes, and a large message textarea.
* **Advanced CSS Styling:**
    * **Flexbox:** Used for overall layout alignment and responsiveness.
    * **Clip-Path:** Implemented a diagonal background design using the `clip-path` property to give the page a modern, professional look.
    * **Custom Inputs:** Overrode default browser styling for a consistent brand feel across the buttons and checkboxes.
* **Organized Workflow:** Maintained a clear separation of concerns with an external CSS file and a dedicated directory for visual assets.

## Lessons Learned
This project was a deep dive into **Form UI Design**. I learned how to style native HTML form elements beyond their defaults while 
keeping the layout structurally sound. Using `clip-path` was particularly rewarding, as it added a modern architectural feel to a
standard data-entry page.

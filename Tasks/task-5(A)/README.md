# Task 05 (A): Keefer Law Firm Website (Pure HTML/CSS)

## Overview
This task focuses on professional-grade responsiveness and high-fidelity layout replication. The goal was to build a sophisticated legal firm
website by translating a complex design into a functional web structure using only **Pure HTML and CSS**. This version emphasizes 
**layout precision** and **authoritative design**, requiring the manual implementation of multi-column structures and textured UI elements.

## Key Features & Implementation
* **Complex Multi-Column Layout:** Implemented a professional "Sidebar-Content-Sidebar" architecture using a mix of Flexbox and Grid-like 
    positioning for desktop views.
* **Component-Based Structure:**
    * **Header & Navigation:** Features a dual-layer header with a dedicated call banner, logo placement, and a clean, responsive navigation bar.
    * **Hero & Lead Gen:** Includes a high-impact guarantee banner and a custom-styled "Confidential Case Evaluation" form for lead generation.
    * **Practice Areas:** A dedicated sidebar with custom-styled "Learn More" buttons and textured spacers.
    * **Credential Showcasing:** Strategic placement of trust badges, Avvo ratings, and professional certifications to build user trust.
* **Responsive Design:** Built with a **mobile-first philosophy**, ensuring that complex tables and sidebars stack gracefully on smaller screens.
* **Pure CSS Styling:** Leveraged CSS variables and pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) to create textures and shadows without relying on 
    external frameworks.

1. **Clone/Download:** Download the full repository ZIP or clone it via Git.
2. **Navigate:** Go to the directory: `task-05(i)/src/`.
3. **Launch:** Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** Semantic markup (header, nav, aside, footer) for better SEO and structure.
* **CSS3:** For advanced styling, manual breakpoints (Media Queries), and Flexbox layouts.
* **Asset Management:** Organized directory for logos, textures, and icons to maintain a professional legal aesthetic.

## Lessons Learned
This task was an intensive exercise in **manual layout control**. It reinforced how to manage complex sidebars and floating elements using 
pure CSS. Handling a "heavy" professional design taught me the importance of maintaining clean code and organized asset paths when working 
without modern utility frameworks.

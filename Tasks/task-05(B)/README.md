# Task 05 (ii): Keefer Law Firm Website (Tailwind CSS)

## Overview
This task focuses on modern, scalable development using a utility-first approach. The goal was to build a high-fidelity replica of the **Keefer Law Firm**
website using **Tailwind CSS**. This version emphasizes **rapid UI development** and **custom theme configuration**, allowing for precise control over the 
firm's specific branding and professional aesthetic.

## Key Features & Implementation
* **Utility-First Architecture:** Leveraged Tailwind's utility classes to build a complex, responsive layout directly in the HTML, significantly reducing
    the need for custom CSS.
* **Custom Theme Configuration:** * **Tailwind Config:** Extended the default theme to include brand-specific colors like `keefer-red`, `keefer-dark-red`,
    and `keefer-gray`.
    * **Typography:** Integrated custom serif font stacks to maintain the authoritative and formal tone of a law firm.
* **Component-Based Structure:**
    * **Responsive Navigation:** Built a dynamic header and navigation system that utilizes Tailwind's `hidden` and `md:block` classes for device-specific
        visibility.
    * **Interactive Hero & Forms:** Designed a professional case evaluation form using Tailwind's spacing and border utilities for a clean, modern look.
    * **Grid System:** Used Tailwind’s powerful `grid-cols` system to manage the complex three-column layout (Practice Areas, Main Content, and Credentials).
* **Advanced Styling:** Combined Tailwind with inline styles for specific background assets (like `menu_bg.gif` and `ft_bg.png`) to replicate the original
    design's textures.

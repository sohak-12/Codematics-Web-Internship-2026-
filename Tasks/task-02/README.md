# Task 02: Landing Page Using Images

## Overview
This task focuses on the intersection of design and development. The goal was to build a complete landing page by translating a visual 
mockup into a functional web structure. The task emphasizes **image management** and **layout precision**, requiring the use of 
specific branding assets, app previews, and section illustrations to create a high-fidelity replica of the original design.

* **Component-Based Structure:** * **Hero Section:** High-impact introduction using branding images.
    * **Feature Sections:** Descriptive areas utilizing app previews and illustrations.
    * **Store Integration:** Styled buttons for Play Store and App Store previews.
    * **Footer:** Clean branding and navigation links.
* **Layout Mastery:** Built with **CSS Flexbox** to ensure consistent spacing, typography, and alignment throughout the page.

# Task 01: Basic Web Page Layout 

## Overview
This project is the first milestone of my **Web Development Internship**. The goal was to build a foundational web layout that strictly adheres to a provided reference design. 
The core challenge of this task was to maintain a professional layout using **purely semantic HTML**, ensuring the document is accessible and well-structured from the ground up.

## Implementation Details
To meet the project requirements, I focused on the following:

* **Semantic-Only Structure:** I used descriptive HTML5 tags to define the page regions. Per the task instructions, **no `<div>` tags** were used in this project.
    * `<header>` & `<nav>` for the top section. 
    * `<main>` for the primary content.
    * `<aside>` for the sidebars.
    * `<footer>` for the bottom section.
* **Precision Alignment:** I utilized **CSS Flexbox** to ensure that text and elements are perfectly centered (both horizontally and vertically) within the main content and side sections.
* **Clean Styling:** The CSS remains minimal, focusing strictly on layout, spacing, and structural alignment to keep the code readable and efficient.

## Project Setup
1.  Ensure you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed.
2.  Clone this repository and navigate to the `tasks/task-01` folder.
3.  Open `t1.html`.
4.  Use the **Live Server** extension in VS Code or simply drag the file into any web browser to view the layout.

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** For semantic document structure.
* **CSS3:** For layout positioning and Flexbox alignment.

## Lessons Learned
This task reinforced my understanding of how semantic tags behave differently than generic containers. It taught me how to create a complex, multi-column layout 
while keeping the code meaningful for search engines and screen readers.
